# Rock Paper Scissors Game

A simple and fun Rock Paper Scissors game built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## About This Project

This project was created as a learning exercise while working through the JavaScript tutorial by SuperSimpleDev. It was a great way to get hands-on experience with fundamental JavaScript concepts, DOM manipulation, and event handling.

The primary goal was to solidify understanding of JavaScript basics in a fun, interactive way.
